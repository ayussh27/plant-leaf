                <li>In addition to starch, potatoes contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</li>
                <li> They’re rich in vitamin C, which is
                    an antioxidant.</li>
                <li> Potatoes were a life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C prevented
                    scurvy.</li>
                <li> Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an electrolyte which aids in the workings of our
                    heart, muscles, and nervous system.</li>
                <li> Potato skin contains fiber, which is important for digestive health.</li>
                <li>
                    Different types of potatoes, especially those that come in other colors, contain more nutrients that
                    have
                    health benefits.</li>
                <li>In general, the darker the potato, the more antioxidants it contains.</li>
                <li>Sweet potatoes are a
                    good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health.</li>
                <li> Purple potatoes are rich in
                    antioxidants including anthocyanins which may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain
                    health.</li>

                <li>The tomato is a fruit from the nightshade family native to South America</li>
